this is a tiny utility function to help processing readable streams line per line

here is a simple example which explains almost everything

	var lines = require('lines');
	var net = require('net');
	
	net.createServer(function(socket) {
	    socket.setEncoding('utf8');
	    lines(socket); // here is where the magic happens
	    socket.on('line', function(line) {
		// line is one line with no trailing \n or \r
	    });
	}).listen('/tmp/mysock');

lines doesn't work on non-encoded streams.

install it via npm
	npm install lines

or get the code on http://github.com/Floby/node-lines and link lines.js from your ~/.node_libraries/
